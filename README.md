# Analysis Summary

The purpose of this analysis was to understand Citi Bike user demographics and tendendies using Tableau. We sought to assess the length of time that bikes are checked out for total riders and genders, the number of trips for all riders and genders per hour of the number of bike trips for each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
